# Recipe Deep-Dive: Analyzing and Predicting Calorie Counts
*By: Rushyendra Katabathuni*

## Introduction

This project analyzes a dataset of recipes which were scraped from food.com and seeks to understand how different recipe factors affect the calorie count of the recipe. Through this project, the data is cleaned and explored. Then, factors of missingness and assessed, hypothesis testing is performed, and finally, machine learning models that predict calorie counts for recipes are built and improved upon.
